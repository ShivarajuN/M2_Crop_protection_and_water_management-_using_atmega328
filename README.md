# M2_Virtual_Fencer_and_Water_Management-_in_Agriculture

## Introduction
- Agriculture is the main source of livelihood of many people in different parts of the world. 
Unfortunately farmers are still reliant on traditional techniques that have evolved hundreds of years 
ago. Due to this the yield of crops are becoming low. Also there are a number of factors that 
contribute to the low yield of crops animal intrusion is also one among them.
- In recent years wild 
animals are special challenge for the farmers throughout the world, Animals like wild boars, elephant, 
tiger and monkeys etc cause serious damage to crops by animals running over the field and trampling 
over the crops. It causes the financial problem to the farmers.
- Farmers with large area of agricultural 
lands find it very tedious to irrigate their land manually. Since there will be unpredictable power cuts 
in villages, they have to manually keep checking the electricity to ON their pump house motors to 
irrigate their fields. Sometimes, the farmers have to check the moisture content in the soil and guess 
the amount of water needed for irrigation. Sometimes it may happen that a given patch of land 
receives more water leading to water-logging, or it might receive far less or no water at all leading to 
dry soil. In either of the cases, the crops can get damaged and farmer may suffer losses.
- By incorporating various advanced sensing and controlling techniques, the crop yield can be 
increased and also animal intrusions can be avoided.

## Objective 
- The main objective of this project is to identify the intrusion of animals in the agricultural 
field and run the animals out from the field.
- To irrigate the field with the help of IoT model.
- To provide optimum maintenance of the motor in field ( Motor ON/OFF based on soil 
moisture )
